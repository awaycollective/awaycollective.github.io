I'm a transmasc Asian-Australian using image synthesis to illustrate fantasy stories, tabletop games and other flights of fancy, as well as to explore naval art history. I also occasionally tinker with code on the side, finding that AI art appeals to both the creative and the technical sides of my brain. It's been fun, though I primarily generate pictures of sailing ships and resplendently rainbow sailing ships!"

I have always been interested in the ability to visualize my dreams and imagination in a way that would not require me to use my hands or fingers very much - I am disabled, and use of my hands for anything more strenuous than typing is generally a non-starter. Ever since then it has been one large, amusing, slightly infuriating, but always joyous rollercoaster."

I've been a digital artist for around 13 years, and with my wrists getting worse and worse, AI art has helped me to continue creating without further injuring my body. I also just think it's really cool! I love messy abstract art and testing the limits of whatever tool I'm using."
